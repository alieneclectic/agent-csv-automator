Further, the \nexclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and \nearnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges and net gain from disposition of \nbusiness.

We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are \nnecessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary \nexpenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or \nwireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nConsolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors \nand other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with \nmanagement's evaluation of operating performance.

You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor\n Relations website.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\n Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong \n performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady \n progress and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, \n EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue \n growth, $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior \n year.\n We're working every day to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for \n our customers. During the quarter, we reached more than 200 million POPs covered by C-band in just over a year since we lit up the first site. With \n access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did, we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our \n customers' overall wireless experience.\n In the first quarter, J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in \n already leading network performance validated by year-to-date RootMetrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band, \n we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access, consumer phone gross adds and retention as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G  \n customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as \n 5G penetration expands market by market.\n We're excited about the rema ining deployment of C-b and spectrum and the potential it w ill unlock for both our bus iness and consumer performance. \n Moving on to mobi lity. On the busines s side, ev en in the current e conomic conditions, my peers across different industries have conveyed confidence \n that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued its run of strong performance, delivering \n 136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector.\n On the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping, evidenced by our increase in consumer \n postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year, with the new to Verizon adds leading the way. Our gross add performance is proof \n that our surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter \n with a sustained momentum around gross adds as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter.\n We remain committed to our strategy, not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers, the \n best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listened to our consumers and introduced exciting \n partners like Peloton and Netflix providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform, and there is more to come. Our \n segmented approach to the market recognizes that one plan doesn't fit all, and we have continued the work to address our underperforming \n segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter.\n By reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a \n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4115, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdb6c953-ef7a-49d5-92d9-dc3ea8c402eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdb6c953-ef7a-49d5-92d9-dc3ea8c402eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e083417-4118-4388-acf8-0bb7e9509c3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "1596430f40d79d2842c660893e02dec4adae2613b9488360bc6febf8cb071fdd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d71021f-2f4f-44f9-b0a0-c09b228d3216", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "ff2846871716fa99f303f3b6a3b0d2d9e30ab8f83bf96e803dfdffa55eca5d50"}}, "hash": "f78073ddf03d0f2545abd9d6ad201c20cd8706a2b11583bef488b2aca5cb87fa", "text": "we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a \n good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited.

We're still in process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important\n part of our value segment strategy and our investments here will continue as we're confident they will pay off in the long term.\n Turning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years,\n adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter, including 67,000 net adds from Fios. We are very pleased with the Fios performance with net\n adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wireless access, we're seeing growth quarter after quarter after quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the\n end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance.\n Our business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as their primary source of broadband connectivity. Won over by the\n reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition to taking share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our\n customer groups leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do.\n Finally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and\n have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This\n quarter, we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with the FAA worth over $2 billion to design, build and operate and maintain the\n FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing projects we're working on for large federal agencies.\n In creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders,\n employees and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business ethics, governance, environmental stewardship\n and human rights are at the center of everything we do.\n I encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the\n issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago, I announced\n new leadership for our 2 business units, the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of\n experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution.\n Let me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear: to enhance our\n consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale fixed wireless access and broadband and drive financial\n discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon Business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions, and nobody knows\n our technology like Kyle.\n His focus is clear: drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private wireless\n and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend,\n enhance and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month,\n after 10 years at Verizon and 6 years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business.\n Tony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May 1.

Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain\n focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion.\n And with that, I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time.\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n Thank you, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the\n investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a\n direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds, among other metrics, where we operate C-band, but more work remains to be done.\n Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had 263,000 net losses for the quarter\n compared to 292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11%\n year-over-year, continuing the momentum from the second half of last year.\n Our efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups\n have been key drivers behind our improved gross adds performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84% and up 7 basis\n points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn,\n performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first\n quarter.\n But as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance, exiting in the quarter with voluntary churn\n rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage\n improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly\n better momentum than a year ago.\n Moving on to the business segment. Verizon Business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our 3 customer groups and had\n 136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a\n couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being\n more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks.\n Moving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we\n saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net adds, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction\n remains high as evidenced by NPS scores as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the Fios side,\n Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000 and up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year.\n Customers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in Fios gross adds\n even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year.\n Fios retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than 5 years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were\n below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans that\n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6af5b56d-e32f-416c-971b-a91cb3ee786d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6af5b56d-e32f-416c-971b-a91cb3ee786d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2f896c3-c87f-4175-ab60-fe55a9413ba6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "c1bfcb3cc1fb64351a35516b01b56afad69768769c35b6ae78ccd42c93b79cdc"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d41b038-d193-40e9-ad57-a016bcf2114e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "a7a53213eb6b6509f51525f84d87b87f1c4884bcadf19897333e23fd7961966b"}}, "hash": "b6393cd8d7f208d178b6852cad19e067690647dd0fa5ea61ecaa7612f787674e", "text": "market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans that\n satisfy the needs of all of our customers.\n You heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue\n being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year.\n As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated\n with the large allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially\n offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the\n removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond.\n We continue to see pressure on service revenue from the costs of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see\n pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented\n additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second\n quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month.\n As a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally,\n the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the\n remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line, driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement\n this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives, resulting in\n a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year.\n During the first quarter, operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost\n of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary\n churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively\n consistent with the prior quarter.\n Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily\n due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer\n payment patterns despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining\n $1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance.\n With the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue\n to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital\n spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an\n increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA\n ratio of 2.7x as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1x improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter.\n We continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 being approximately $600 million\n due in the second quarter.

Brad, we're ready to take questions this morning.\n Operator\n (Operator Instructions) The first question for today comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\n John Hodulik  - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst\n Great. And Matt, thanks for all the help over the years and best of luck to you in the future. If I could just start with a couple of wireless questions.\n First on the gross adds on the consumer side, obviously, some strength there. Any other detail you can give us in terms of what's driving the\n double-digit improvement. I think AT&T saw a decline.\n If there's just any change in the sort of promotional posture or anything you're doing there? And then on the other side of the ledger, churn,\n obviously up a little bit year-over-year, but it sounds like you're making some trends. Did you guys make any pricing changes on the consumer\n side in the first quarter? And just -- any comments around the sustainability of those improvements as we look forward throughout the year?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n Thank you. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Matt. I think what we saw in the first quarter was very much the momentum. We start building\n I would say, end of the third and into the fourth when it comes to both how we converted our customers to be part of our journey with the more\n segmented approach. And that we have seen through the quarter when it comes to our gross adds that many of the initiatives we have had all the\n way from the welcome plan and many of the others, they have been working well for us. So that's partly what we have been doing.\n And then, of course, I think we're much more focused. And of course, now with the new team in place as well, where we have full alignment with\n Sampath when it comes to the execution here and seeing that we're getting the right customers in. I think that has been helpful as well. Then as\n you have seen, we're coming in and out of the quarter with promotions. We really are taking the opportunity when we see that we have an\n opportunity to bring in customers. So that's how are you seeing the momentum continue.

But as I said, I mean, we had a little bit higher in the beginning of the quarter and it continued to\n improve. And we are working with both that as well as we continue to create the momentum we have right now on the consumer wireless. Matt?\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n Thanks, Hans. So on the churn side, certainly, we saw improvement as the quarter went on. We had a little carryover from holiday level churn in\n January by the time we got to March, we saw a much better momentum there. So that's the jump-off point as we go into second quarter. The\n pricing changes that you mentioned in your question really didn't go into effect until we kind of came to the moving from Q1 to Q2 so that will be\n incremental to the results of the business here as we get into the rest of the year.\n So -- but as Hans said, really a case of rebuilding from the momentum last year that was a year ago was not where we wanted it to be. At the\n midpoint of the year, we talked about taking actions, and you see the results of those actions showing up in the results. And so the team is focused\n on continuing to build from there.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\n Brett Feldman  - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst\n I'd also like to reiterate my thanks to Matt for all his help over the years. My question is about fixed wireless. So when I look at the formal remarks\n document you put out, it looks like you still have just over 40 million households where that can get your fixed wireless service. The reason I bring\n it up is that would appear to be a fraction of the availability of your ultra-wideband network, which now covers over 2/3 of the population.\n So I was wondering, how do we think about the game plan for expanding the distribution of the fixed wireless service now that you have significantly\n expanded the ultra-broadband -- ultra-wideband network? And how do we think about the cadence of quarterly fixed wireless access here? Is\n there still going to be a tailwind? Or are we getting to a point where it's leveling now?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n Thank you, Brett. First of all, we're really pleased with the performance on the fixed wireless access. The team is doing a great work. And remember,\n it's not only the consumer side, it's the business side as well on the business side. Many new use cases are coming up on using fixed wireless access.\n So the team are scaling, and we're on scale right now. So like the rhythm I see on our sales promotions right now. And if you see in the first quarter,\n almost 400,000.\n When it comes to the network, you know that later -- the latter part of this year in December, actually -- or we will get our next chunk of C-band.\n Right now, we're covering some 70 markets out of all 400. So it's 330 markets left, we will get the C-band. And we clearly pointed out in the opening\n here that where we opened the C-band. We're not only seeing fixed-wire access opportunity. We also see step-ups and a greater upgrade cycle\n for our customers because they see the improvements on the C-band. So we're very encouraged by the C-band coming out. But as I said, we're\n waiting for the clearance by the year-end to get even more. But as we roll out right now, we open up markets.\n And remember, we talked about that we are in the network team, we're now decentralizing so we can attack locally because we are sort of opening\n markets locally. The same goes what Sampath is working on right now is also taking his operations more locally, so we can both the marketing and\n execution locally. And you might have seen it that we do more local things because as we open up more on fixed wireless access. We do that locally.\n And so far, our success rate is high.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3883, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d093c1a-04c9-4648-8045-0d0d0637894b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d093c1a-04c9-4648-8045-0d0d0637894b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d14569fd-572c-40f8-9f0b-0101b7bc7511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "c468ca3e3627a2804ca070584b4ecbe5f8dd23b6ebb2c70f2f4cbe95c8876586"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4290fb6-7c6c-4a86-9150-38355ba3b213", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "f5cd958232b276e9b378147e1f9b1c2be61be28b93404afcbbac6513e2b47ace"}}, "hash": "dcae09d5001512a978f4ba456da2213a33ee4410fe16a1a3ee673f98a98ad099", "text": "access.

There's a lot more to be done\n there.\n But as I said, I'm very pleased with the rhythm and the market share we're taking and remember, the C-band, so far is deployed mainly in urban\n and suburban areas, the majority of the spectrum coming is actually in more of the suburban and rural. And we also get, of course, more urban\n spectrum as we're only deploying 60, maybe 80-somewhat megahertz, 100 where we are, in average, 160. So I have to say this is one of the biggest\n 5G use cases we have right now, and we really seeing good traction. So that's how we're going forward.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Yes. Thanks, Brett.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\n Simon Flannery  - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD\n Again, my best wishes to Matt for the future. Just following up on Brett's fixed wireless question. You talked about scaling. It looks like you're almost\n hitting 2 million fixed wireless subscribers now. How is it working on the network capacity side of things? And what's your confidence in going to\n continue to handle increasing usage from the customers as this continues to scale?\n And then if we could just go back to the announcement, I think it was March 3 of the new appointments. You talked a little bit about Kyle and\n Sampath. But what if we were inside Verizon, what are the big changes that have taken place over the past 7 weeks or so that are really changing\n the trajectory, particularly of consumer.\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n Thank you, Simon. On the capacity, we -- the guys is great. First of all, were used on an initial trends of spectrum that we're using, as I said, we were\n fixed wireless access on the ultra-wideband. We have so much more capacity coming. On top of that, all the new features you have with advanced\n 5G carrier aggregation, we have new devices coming out that can handle different spectrum.\n So there are so many more things I feel really confident that we will manage this capacity without any problems to the levels we have talked about\n and way beyond that. Then, of course, as I talked with many of you guys, if it comes a moment that we have a community that have a lot of fixed\n wireless access we will have over time, other opportunities of cell splitting, et cetera. We are not even close to that today.\n So I feel really good about how the guys are managing the network and the opportunities we're building on our C-band here. As I said, on the 4G\n fixed wireless access, they were more opportunistic and selling when we see that we have capacity, but not sort of where we see that we have that\n full. We're not selling any more. But this expansion is right now on 5G Ultra Wideband.\n When it comes to the new team, the big changes I've seen, first of all, the first big change is that these guys are operational day one. I mean both\n Kyle and Sampath is straight into it. If you look at Sampath, he's very much focused both on the customer dimension and seeing that we were\n improving the momentum we have right now on gross adds and churn and see that we actually improving through the year. But he also works\n with our offerings and our operations, see that we're even stronger locally. Kyle, on the other hand, continuing the work of Sampath, great momentum\n on Business Wireless as we continue this quarter private networks is really taking off.\n 9\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv.

First, can you expand on the bad debt and churn discussion and how that relates to the upgrades, which seem to be fading through\n the quarter? And then second, if you can talk about prepaid. Are the losses mostly happening in SafeLink and what is happening in this and the\n different brands and any conversion of prepaid to postpaid this quarter? And how would you report that if it was happening?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n Okay. That was a lot of questions in one. I will start on the high level here on the -- as we said earlier, the payment patterns are basically same as\n pre-COVID. We have a high-quality customer base. We see this as a very healthy at the moment, all the way. I will ask Matt to expand on that because\n looking backwards. And then when it comes to the question on prepaid, or value segment, yes, as we said in an opening here, I mean, the negative\n number is, I would say, 100% coming from SafeLink, which is a government-subsidized brand.\n But there are other puts and takes there as well. I think that the visible brand is doing well. We're just ramping up total wireless, which is an important\n piece of it, not having all the things coming through there. So -- and then, of course, we have the network migration still happening. So it's\n combination of a lot of things on the different brands. Our confidence is that we will improve that at the latter part of the year when some of these\n things are moving out. So that's a general comment, maybe on the churn piece, Matt, if you say something.\n 10\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thanks, Phil. So looking at the churn and the bad debt and to your question was more around the bad debt side. So certainly up a little bit\n year-over-year, but more importantly, flat sequentially. And what you're really seeing is first quarter last year, we still had some impacts in there of\n some of the COVID-related activities. That's now fully out.\n And I'd say we're back to perpetual type run rate. In terms of the -- with the lower upgrades in there, also the plus 11% phone gross adds, as Hans\n mentioned in his prepared remarks, a lot of those gross adds were new to Verizon. And those new to Verizon customers typically come in at a\n different bad debt accrual rate than upgrades, which is existing customers that we know well and so that's the trade-off there.\n The other thing I look at on the bad debt side. One, you see from our most recent ABS filings at our FICO scores across our base continues to be\n very strong. We've talked for many years now about the quality of the Verizon postpaid base and you see that there. And then secondly, the payment\n patterns we actually had from customers this quarter actually just slightly better sequentially in terms of the aging. So we're seeing good behavior,\n good payment activity from our customer base, which is why you see the flat bad debt on a sequential basis now that we're fully through the COVID\n period.\n Philip Cusick  - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst\n If I can just follow up, was there any conversion from prepaid to postpaid? Or I may have missed it.\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n A little bit, but nothing material, but that's obviously certainly something the team is very focused on going forward, having that opportunity in\n there, got that's still ahead of them to be a much more meaningful contributor going forward.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Yes. Thanks, Phil.\n Operator\n The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\n David Barden  - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD\n Thanks for all the help, Matt. I guess in the prepared remarks, Matt, I think you mentioned that there were going to be some cost efficiency benefits\n in 2023. I was wondering if you could kind of -- in that $2 billion to $3 billion target, talk about the cadence of how you see that unfolding in maybe\n the second half of this year and into the coming years?\n And then the second question would be one of the things that's contributed to, I think, the momentum that you guys have been talking about a\n lot on the call has been a combination of the new kind of more affordable welcome unlimited plan and a lot of the marketing you've been doing.\n Could you talk about what the new kind of management team wants to do to take that maybe to another level, if at all, this year and kind of what\n the end goal is flat subscribers the goal? Or is market share the goal? That would be helpful.\n 11\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

The team is working\n through SMB, government and large enterprises with our offerings where the network is the key contributor.\n Kyle will continue that work and the drumbeat we have there. On the consumer side, I think that Sampath and I are 100% aligned that we are in a\n momentum where we are now going to continue to improve our net additions on consumer, but most importantly is to grow in the service revenue\n but of course, we want customers as well. But mostly important is growing the service revenue and expanding the cash flow and EBITDA. That's\n really the main focus for Sampath that were 100% aligned on. But that also means that we need to take customers. And I think that we will continue\n to evolve our proposition and coming with new products.\n So I feel encouraged what I've seen so far and the thinking that Sampath and the team have, but we need to stay tuned for some of the new things\n coming, Tony?\n Tony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate\n Thanks, Hans. David. So on the cost side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're making progress with Verizon Global Services and all the\n cost transformation efforts. As we mentioned previously, we're on track with our cost efficiency program to take $2 billion to $3 billion of cost out\n by 2025. Within that, we'll see some of those benefits manifest themselves in the second half of this year in '23 with significant savings in 2024 and\n really focused on areas like sourcing, transformation, IT conversions and transformations as well as supply chain and other AI models.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Yes. Thanks, Dave.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\n Michael Rollins  - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst\n Matt, I also want to express my thanks and best wishes as you leave Verizon. If I could focus on 2 topics. First, on the ARPU side, if you can unpack\n a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on the unlimited and premium unlimited take rates and where those can go over time in terms of\n continuing to monetize the network and the bundles that you offer? And then on the lower upgrade rate, are you seeing a fundamental change\n in customer holding periods for devices and what does that mean for the size of the switcher pool in the industry going forward?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n I can start. I mean, we -- I can on a high level, say we continue to see the trends from our customer on postpaid going to unlimited and then go to\n unlimited premium. That continues, the team is doing great work to see that we're doing that transition. And -- but we still have opportunities. We\n still have customer metered plans. We still have a portion on unlimited, it can go to unlimited premium.\n So we still see that as an important growth trajectory for our ARPU going forward. And then on the upgrades, I mean, we have talked about before,\n I mean the market indication is that it's going to be a little bit smaller switcher pool. That doesn't mean that we feel that we shouldn't be taking\n more fair share. We should definitely do that and continue to see that our customers that we have, we're expanding with them, and then we're\n 12\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv.

So -- and continue that drumbeat, Matt?\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n Yes. No, exactly, Hans. And Mike, so as you think about it, the strategy is 1 always to get the customer in, then have the opportunity to move\n customers up the stack and you see we've done that number of different ways over the years, and you should expect us to continue to find ways\n to do that.\n And then also, we get the opportunity to add other things to the account, so fixed wireless access allows us to increase ARPA and adding other\n devices to the accounts, too.

Just from a government program perspective, can you share how Verizon participates in ACP? And\n any new thoughts on potentially participating in the BEAD program?\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n Yes. So I'll take the first shot. Look, ACP is an important program. As you've seen, the actions we've taken over the past few years, whether it's the\n acquisition of Tracfone, the introduction of plans like Welcome. We want to participate in all customer segments. That includes ACP, whether that\n be on the wireless side or the fixed side. So we do participate in those programs. And then as the BEAD programs come out, we will look for where\n it makes the most sense for us to participate in those programs. We've been doing -- we've been building fiber out to our homes for a long time.\n We continue to do so.\n Over 500,000 new OFS last year, we said we'd do something in that same region again this year and into the foreseeable future at that type of run\n rate. So as that those new programs help us the opportunities to continue to do that will certainly be very interested in looking at using them\n where it makes sense.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Yes. Great. Thanks, Mike.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\n Craig Moffett  - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst\n I want to sort of step back to a more strategic question about the wireless business, if I could. I mean for years, your business model and your --\n and sort of the way you came to market was based on a very low churn strategy, therefore, arguably, you didn't need the same number of gross\n adds to sustain growth.

And despite what you said about the prospects for churn, churn is quite a bit higher for\n retention. How do you kind of win the battle for the hearts and minds, particularly in the consumer segment by sort of returning to the base of\n convincing customers that yours is really the best network and sort of how do you win with the value proposition?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n I will start here. First of all, what we see right now is we have a clear value proposition when we roll out the C-band. We have great uptake, step-ups\n from our customers when they see the C-band. And you know better than anybody else how much of that spectrum we have right now, which is\n a very little bit. And with all that, we get this momentum, that's why I feel so good about it.\n And then as Matt said, our churn a little bit elevated, but it's also improving in the quarter. So we're working on that. And having a gross -- the gross\n adds momentum at the same time. That tells you something about where we're going right now heading. And then we have Sampath in the role\n that really no operational execution. So I think we have all that and we have the best network clearly, and it's just going to get better. I mean with\n every measurement we do right now, we are clearly come out as #1.\n And the only thing I know for sure. We're going to extend that leadership with the C-band continue to roll out. So our proposition is very clear,\n continue to have the best network, have a good proposition for our customer because you need to continue to do new offerings to the consumer\n group because their behaviors are changing as well. That's why we came with it, +play. We're listening to customers to make it easier and all of\n that. And you haven't seen the loss from us. So I think that we're building on all the strength we have and those strengths are even getting stronger.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Thanks, Craig.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\n Timothy Horan  - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst\n Can you be a little clearer on the network upgrades -- it looks like you're more than doubling the amount of spectrum by year-end. What does that\n mean for coverage, do you think, and capacity? And when will we get to 300 million homes passed and more like 70 million or 80 million that have\n the ability to get fixed wireless?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n So on the network, you're absolutely right. We have just -- on the C-band we have just started to roll it out in the majority of the 60, 70 markets\n we're rolling out right now, we're using 60 megahertz. And you know we have an average 160 megahertz and in many places, even up to 200\n megahertz. So it's an enormous difference when it comes from 60 to 160 megahertz, how much more capacity there is and on top of that, of course,\n we are adding new type of software features like carrier aggregation, the chip sets is getting better in devices, both the handset and the fixed\n wireless access devices.\n So that's going to enhance the capacity for us. And as I said, we were very focused to see that we materialize our business cases for the C-band, all\n the way from consumer and business wireless to fixed wire access and mobile edge compute and private networks. So we focus on the revenue\n generation of it, and we'll continue to do so. But clearly, it's going to be a step-up when we get the next tranche. And we're going to open more\n homes or households penetrated with fixed wireless access, and we're going to have much more markets covered by the C-band. So we're just\n going to continue that journey as fast as we can.\n 14\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f33dbdf5-033f-47c0-bccb-ac0ec545a866": {"__data__": {"id_": "f33dbdf5-033f-47c0-bccb-ac0ec545a866", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2c2fef3-e5e5-4507-986f-9478297c8dcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "08213571a885c8fdbf452210d91e71c1dd42e7d36849bf11c34865b8ae639be6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4db03e6a-a7e7-4afc-bb3c-36b56483e596", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "1Q23-VZ-Transcript-042523a.pdf"}, "hash": "47dcd8a045cc02ed292790a4486be5c85a41189d1857151b7ddcaaf9ae03a45e"}}, "hash": "c59d2bb37b3c4fce1f67d8dcd2cf11dda8c8f2e404362ee97b89e345fbff8f93", "text": "| www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv.

There is -- we don't need\n any new. However, we always build some new sites. We find new areas where there have been capacity constraints.\n We'll continue to do that as well.

Great, Tim.\n Operator\n The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.\n Kannan Venkateshwar  - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst\n Thank you. Hans, strategically, you face a few choices, which I think are contradictory in some way, and there is an attempt to grow gross adds,\n obviously, but SG&A is growing faster than revenues, and so that puts pressure on margins. And it also comes with cash flow trade-offs. And you\n are trying to increase price to offset this margin impact, but that comes with churn trade-offs.\n So ultimately, when you think about your growth model or the growth algorithms what's the north star? Is it unit growth? And are you willing to\n sacrifice margins and cash flow to get to that turnaround point? Or is it margins? Even if it comes at the expense of unit growth because it does\n feel like there is a choice that has to be made at some point. And I'm just wondering what the metric is that you're most focused on?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n I think it's crystal clear. Our metrics that we're measured on is the service revenue and the EBITDA and cash flow expansion. You still need to have\n customers for that, and you need to grow that. But ultimately, that's what we measure ourselves on to see that we can grow that. And that's what\n you have seen from us right now. And you see the cash flow in the quarter. We are very focused on that. We think that's very important for all the\n stakeholders. And so then, of course, units are important, but it's even more important to see that we have the right growth metrics when it comes\n to the company's finance. But maybe Tony wants to add something here.\n Tony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate\n To just add on to what Hans mentioned. I mean we have to be disciplined and segmented in how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes\n that drive profitable revenue growth. So the team is laser focused on that.\n 15\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Is there any reason that expansion shouldn't support accelerated marketing and approval of\n inbounds about FWA so that you would drive up your net adds in those markets as well?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n That's clear. I mean, and that's why our organization, both on the consumer side and the business side and our network side, it's more regional\n right now because we're following the sort of the deployment of the network and doing marketing and outreach to our customers on fixed wireless\n access that really want to have it when we open up. So clearly, you're right, there is also opportunity in the urban places where we get more capacity\n or more coverage and as it goes for the suburban and the rural.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Great. Thanks, Peter. Brad, we have time for one more question.\n Operator\n Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\n Frank Louthan  - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research\n Can you -- with the business changes, can you walk us through on the SaaS line? What is sort of SaaS revenue in total and where can you see growth\n there? And then back to the phone adds with the new level of gross adds you're getting, are there any characteristics about this type of customer\n you're tracking now that might be different than, say, 2 years ago and what their long-term churn characteristics might be?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n So you need to repeat the first question. You're talking about SaaS revenues?\n Frank Louthan  - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research\n Well, with the breakout -- new breakout on the business line item. Just curious how much of that line that includes SaaS. Is SaaS revenue and what\n is that growing?\n 16\n REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n \u00a92023 Refinitiv.

We don't disclose the SaaS revenue specifically, so.\n Matt Ellis  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\n Yes.

And then what was the second part of the question, Frank?\n Frank Louthan  - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research\n So with the gross adds that you're getting, are there any characteristics about these customers you're tracking today that are maybe different from\n what they were, say, 2 years ago. And I'm curious about what you think about the long-term churn characteristics of customers you're tracking\n today, particularly given the heavier promotional activity that you've done versus what you did historically?\n Hans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\n In general, I think the churn characteristics, all the new customers coming in is even better than before for many reasons, as you said yourself. And\n then the type of customers, I think Matt talked a little bit on the type of gross adds we're getting is new customers to Verizon, where they come in.\n And of course, we have opportunities to upgrade and step up them and also having opportunities for our converged offerings. So really good\n quality of the customers coming in, as Matt said as well. So we feel really good about the growth momentum we have and the customers we are\n getting.\n Brady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\n Yes. Thanks, Frank.

Further, the \nexclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and \nearnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset rationalization and net gain \nfrom disposition of business.

For purposes of \nNet Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months.  \nAdjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast\nAdjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial \ninformation in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. \nWe believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period  \nAdjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related \nintangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and asset rationalization .\nWe exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, \nnumber and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable \ncycle, and the amount of an acquisition\u2019s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary \nsignificantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between \nour newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash \nflow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not \nrepresent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments \nmade or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is \nimportant to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities.

Business \nMarkets and Other combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers \npreviously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale \ncustomer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. \nThere was no change to the composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit.\nThe segment financial results and metrics above exclude the effects of special items (other than the effects of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization), which \nthe Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance.\nCertain intersegment transactions with corporate entities have not been eliminated.Verizon Communications Inc.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2950, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55a95b5f-e4e2-491b-9423-6539474708a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "55a95b5f-e4e2-491b-9423-6539474708a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "VZ-FS-2023Q2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e461856d-7730-49a5-a561-d8d13d708a14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "VZ-FS-2023Q2.pdf"}, "hash": "dd8ccfcc81583a9a3de0d1b6d5a35693300dd20f326a42abdeb8adfc5bab4322"}}, "hash": "dd8ccfcc81583a9a3de0d1b6d5a35693300dd20f326a42abdeb8adfc5bab4322", "text": "Business - Selected Operating Statistics\nUnaudited 6/30/23 6/30/22%\nChange\nConnections (\u2018000):\nWireless retail postpaid  29,105  28,208 3.2\nWireless retail postpaid phones  17,856  17,586 1.5\nFios video  64  70 (8.6)\nFios internet  380  367 3.5\nFWA broadband  870  316 *\nWireline broadband  464  474 (2.1)\nTotal broadband  1,334  790 68.9\nUnaudited3 Mos.

Me and my team are pleased to report another\nsolid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains\ncommitted to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash\nflow.\nWe're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year\nand adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow\nwas $5.6 billion.\nThe actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our\nability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband\nand cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.\nBased on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to\nthe hard work and the dedication of our team.\nNow let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation\nand financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade\nlevels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking\nfor ways to do better.\nIn May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns\nwith our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped\nour Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving\nhigher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving\nour offerings to fit customers' needs.\nWe will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we\nreported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high\nvalue they place on our services.\nOur ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider\nwith elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We\nare strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.\nVerizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular\ndecline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating\nthe resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.\nOn private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation\nprivate networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,\nand federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.\nThe total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our\nbroadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4217, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec843718-f448-44a8-b6d4-74b9f2036f5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec843718-f448-44a8-b6d4-74b9f2036f5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ab25a94-3d1d-4ec6-8fc5-2ff5ce6d2e68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "hash": "dd5d53db92ac34e754be6b9a008ca849149efa28f6dcd82e440e46ab9b1b35e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "872a5ee3-ee37-4345-86e1-23ca9d512982", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "hash": "bcd9fdfb9d504fc2d98765fd9dece5061da57fcec93aad03f8af418e4efd2f0d"}}, "hash": "94c40f25ee5158a9bf9e50837cd70af64f1870dcf82c96737234c06975fa744f", "text": "strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable\nbroadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our\ngrowth trajectory.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv.

We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price, and speed tiers so that our\ncustomers can choose the service that best suits them.\nFurther, we continue to see Net Promoter Scores for wireless and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings.\nWe have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a last tranche of the C-band spectrum. For the\n31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power's U.S. Wireless Network Quality Study, no other\nwireless provider has achieved this, and for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power Study Factors in all 6 regions.\nAdditionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country and successfully testing our\nability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of\nthe largest base of wireless customers in the United States.\nNext, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take this matter seriously, and to be very clear, lead\ninfrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At\nVerizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we're using a fact and science-based approach\nin our assessment. You will hear more on the topic from Tony later on.\nOur accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters are already paying off. Verizon\nGlobal Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation,\nleveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains.\nWe're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025, these savings in combination with the completion of\nthe $10 billion C-band spend position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we\nexecute on our capital allocation strategy.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our 3 priorities of growing wireless service\nrevenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working and we remain on track\nto meet our financial guidance for 2023.\nWe are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance while remaining\nfinancially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results both sequentially and year-over-year\nin postpaid phone net adds.\nAdditionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth.\nThe results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution. Consumer postpaid phone net losses\ntotaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022.\nConsumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new to Verizon gross adds, which increased\napproximately 19% over the prior year period.

Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up 1 basis point compared\nwith the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn.\nOur involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter.\nIt is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross\nadd growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non-C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was 4 basis points lower\nin C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.\nLet's now look at our business results. Verizon business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading\nwireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all 3 customer groups resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter compared\nto 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter\nwhere we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds.\nWe continue to win high-value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent\ngovernment contract win where we took share from 2 of our competitors at attractive ARPUs.\nMoving on to broadband, we maintain our strong performance with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past 4\nquarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that\ntime. Growth in FWA remained healthy with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers\non our FWA product that we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter.\nOn the Fios side, Internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness\nin household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to\ntake steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year.\nPrepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent a low point as we continue to\nmake progress integrating TracFone while taking actions to better position us for growth including scaling our visible and total by Verizon brands.\nAs Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter.\nLet's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline\ncan be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year as postpaid phone upgrade activity\ndeclined 34% versus the same period last year.\nService and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8%\nyear-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions including a recent\nchange to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue\ninto wireless service revenue and growth in fixed wireless access drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued\npressure from the amortization of handset promotions.\nWe are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions\nto better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our\nFWA bundled pricing for new customers which we expect will provide service revenue", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53533273-8bf9-4b1e-867d-2576b91ae782": {"__data__": {"id_": "53533273-8bf9-4b1e-867d-2576b91ae782", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "89c21bc5-b2ac-459c-966e-aaef888f57d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "hash": "33ab3cf297630957c8e9858d90700f136360289a0e6ce38cba292d9354ded7a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "b32e47c8-d80d-4533-8256-b80b76034c96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "VZ-Transcript-2023Q2.pdf"}, "hash": "a7122776a9a52c08cf37f88bde61f8a8483c884fcbbcf69286f205144fa0f7e9"}}, "hash": "73d5136f32648767f261ecfe7a0b82b0122a76fb3b6f8c70f94c47e90e5f4096", "text": "bundled pricing for new customers which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year.\nAdditionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization of promotional costs in the second half of the year given the softer upgrade environment\nand our disciplined approach to promotional spending.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis\npoints over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes and improved service revenue.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv.

Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter and payment trends remain consistent with recent quarters and\nprepandemic levels.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of\nequipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives\nwithin our Verizon Global Services organization.\nDuring the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products.\nWe are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts and continue to make progress towards\nachieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion compared to $17.7\nbillion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and\nfewer upgrades which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense.\nCapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-band program. Capital spending for\nthe first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be\nwithin our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.\nOur peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx which we expect will continue into 2024. The net\nresult of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cash flow for the first half of the year\nis $8 billion and nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination of our lower CapEx spend compared to the\nprior year and operating cash flow benefits previously mentioned.\nWhile we do not normally guide on free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the\nfull year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous\nquarter and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year.\nWe ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities with no remaining\nobligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the second quarter a\n0.1x improvement both sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given the recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases\nlater in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's\nno change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.\nBefore I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead-sheathed cables in our network. Here is what we currently\nknow. We still have some lead-sheathed cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry,\nrecords are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable on our network has lead sheathing.\nHowever, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of\ncable, roughly half of which is aerial and lead-sheathed cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network.

Can you guys tighten up that number for us a little bit? That would be great.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nThank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you see in this quarter,\nwe are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components, I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA\nexpansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth.\nAnd then, of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well. I mean 8 quarters, more than 125,000. So we're actually doing a lot\nof things in different areas. But then if you go to the Consumer Group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be\nsegmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers.\nAnd myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about 70% of taking the premium plan. So -- but that's just the\nstart of it. We're not done. But clearly, I'm confident that the team knows how to manage this, given how much we invested in research on the\nconsumer side to understand our consumers better and that's why we launched myPlan.\nSo all in all, I have to say the guys are doing well, but I'm confident we will continue on this stride. But maybe Tony can give you some more on\nthat, and then we can come back to the lead.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nYes. Thanks, Hans. So on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When\nyou think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you.\nAs you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the legacy unlimited plans that we did earlier in the\nquarter as well as most recently, changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles.\nSecondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix, and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the\nUnlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and\nwe have great momentum on FWA.\nAnd then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly,\nwhen you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters.\nAnd that's -- it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So when you put that all together, we're very confident\nthat all the initiatives here will continue to drive meaningful revenue growth in the second half.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nOn the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously. And we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and\nfact-based whereas Tony said, we're going over the different places that were pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal\nand external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based,\nscientific and that's how we're going to do. And that's what you should expect from us.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network.\nSo that work is still ongoing as well. So we still have more work to do there. And as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman  - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD\nI think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year-over-year,\nbut I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about the path getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones, do\nyou think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing or even any additional internal adjustments? Or do\nyou think you have the places -- pieces in place, and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nI think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team together with Tony and\nme with the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We have segmented above the market. We work with financial discipline. The target\nwe have for our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as Sampath and the team said before, we -- ultimately, we want our fair share also\non the net adds.\nBut ultimately, we measure ourselves on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So it's more about now executing\non this being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving and some of the numbers that Tony talked\nabout, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out.\nAnd then myPlan. You see also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the\nright place. So all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution\nand doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.\nBrett Feldman  - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD\nAnd how do we think about a time line for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer. Is that something that would be a reasonable\nexpectation once you have C-band fully deployed?\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nBrett, it's Tony. So volumes are important to the business. And as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market.\nOur focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect\nimprovements year-over-year in consumer net adds and the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks Brett.

It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what\nthis is going to mean in terms of your footprint, both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side, how do we think that's going to help both\ncoverage and also capacity.\nI know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It would be great to let us know what your experience has been\nwith usage and how you feel good about handling that 4 million to 5 million and beyond over the next few years?\nAnd then maybe a quick one for Tony. Obviously, the stock has been under some pressure here, pretty high yield. Perhaps remind us about how\nyou're thinking about potentially going to buybacks. You're seeing some deleveraging now strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option\nhere in the not-too-distant future.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nThank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we're ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team\nis ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course, more coverage as well. So it gave us both. And as\nyou have seen in the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course,\nwe'll open up fixed wireless access. So that should be positive over time for us.\nAnd when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean the guys are doing an enormously good\njob as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity, network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the\nright for our customers.\nAnd remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed\nwireless access, in some cases, private networks, so all that is in one, and that's the efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we\nexpected when we started with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out on the next\nyear here. So I'm confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nOkay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the\nend of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that it is higher -- running higher than\nnormal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority\nfor us.\nThe cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities\nare unchanged. We said, first, we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to\ndelever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Simon, Brad, we are ready for next question.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv.

I\nmean, it could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here?\nAnd then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there? And how long it takes for that to be a $1\nbillion business?\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nI'll start with the second question, and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've\nbeen doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on\nit, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on licensed spectrum. And then you start adding on to it.\nUsually it start with one factory. And if you see that are working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming\nin, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge\nNetwork. I don't expect that it's $1 billion business this year. But it definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth\nin the service revenue and actually doing even better in the -- with enterprises.\nSo it's going to take some time, but I'm really pleased with what I've seen in the last couple of quarters, how this is turning out. And I would say we\nhave now an ecosystem with devices, with radio base stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So I'm more optimistic\nthan a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field. And that's\nwhy I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nPhil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price up from last year. We do expect\nsequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125\nmillion. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter, that's probably one additional data\npoint for you.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Phil, Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv.

Are you anticipating having to subsidize any more for handsets to get adds as the\nyear goes on?\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nOn the broadband side, I think I got the question like that the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that\non the fixed wireless access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the ILEC because that's just how it is because the Fios\nis so strong. So we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you have seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before,\nwe're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So Fios is doing really well.\nAnd then, of course, we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something,\nbut it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owner's economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios, we have one network, we\nare our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not and that nobody else has\nin the industry. So really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've\ndone.\nWe have substantial new customers there. So this is a great opportunity and as you saw right now we continue doing as we have done. I mean we\nhave now 2.3 [million] (corrected by company after the call) customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different\npricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers\nbecause they can choose between different models, depending on what needs they have.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nYes. And the only other thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, another -- the\nthird consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds, and we continue to see good momentum with customers taking -- wireless customers\ntaking FWA and we see great progress there as well.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nAnd then you had a question on upgrades. And as you have seen, and promos. That is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as\nwell. There are many reasons where some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also haven't\nbeen in any major new devices coming out.\nIt will probably come on in the second half. It usually comes, so we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels\nwe've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we're going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and\nupgrades where there is the best for the segment and for the customer, but will not come back to the levels that we saw before.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Frank.

Before the lead, this was the big issue. And if there were 2\npillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry, one was that somehow Verizon had negotiated a deal with the\ncable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took.\nAnd the second was that, that deal would never end. It was going to be forever. And so I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from\nVerizon a little bit and that maybe that the idea that cable industry is guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable\nregardless of data consumption, that that's not true.\nAnd then this deal isn't permanent, it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ, obviously, you need to have a some deal, but it\ndoesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nDavid, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have NDA's when it comes\nto our contracts. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon is making money on this, that's I can tell you, and we think this is an important\nbusiness. These are important customers to us.\nAnd again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections and more usage and the more revenue we\nhave on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that's happening, we will continue the work we're doing, however, I cannot go\ninto specifics on the contracts because, first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. So -- but clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that\nwith the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So -- and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\nMichael Rollins  - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst\nTwo questions, if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed, is there also an\nopportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of\nconsumption?\nAnd then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash CapEx is tracking to guidance. But just curious, as you're deploying the mid-band spectrum,\nthe depth of it, and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the\nbusiness as usual indication of CapEx for 2024.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n\u00a92023 Refinitiv.

On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G., I think we find a good model within\nmyPlan right now with different type of network options, then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should see the first sort of\nlaunch here as the first time we come out with the platform.\nWe see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that one in different ways to meet different customer demands. So you will probably\nsee more of that going forward, how we'll do that. So clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and\nthings like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan.\nOn the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hump here coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, investing in fiber,\ninvesting to -- in all the parts of millimeter wave, then coming into the hump of C-band, now we come into the BAU. As far as we can see right now,\nis BAU is around $17 billion to $17.5 billion. And that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about is\ncoming down. Fiber is more success-based. So there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels,\nand our team is really doing a great job.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Mike. Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.\nCraig Moffett  - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst\nTwo questions, if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for one moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used overlashing\nof fiber to what might potentially be lead cables particularly in your aerial plant in the Northeast.\nAnd then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of\nsteadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end\nof 2025. So I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nThank you, Craig. I'll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one. And the lead, we will hear from Tony on\nthat one. On the fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we are now running on a fairly high level, adding broadband subscriber quarter. Remember,\n-- we have defined -- we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70% of the PAs of C-band so far out of 402, so that, of course, is how many OFS\nor open for sales, we can do right now. So that is a little bit -- the next step is going to be the next tranche coming in.\nAnd I said, we're well ahead for the 4 million to 5 million, the team is doing a great job. We also saw that we now are doing some great work on\nhow we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we're\nmanaging our network is going great. And of course, as an ambitious leader, as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's\nthe forecast we have, 4 million to 5 million. And we are really doing well. And the customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so\nsimple. You install it yourself. You get broadband immediately.\nSo we're just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing basically. So I'm really pleased with the product.

It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical\nrecords, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical\napproach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information. And as we learn more, we'll keep\nyou updated.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Craig. Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft  - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Senior Analyst\nI want to ask 2, if I could. I guess, First, just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network\nretirements and therefore, an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities\nmight want to not have lead cable in their communities, even if it isn't actually shedding any lead.\nAnd then secondly, I just had a follow-up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-band deployments will affect the\nfixed wireless opportunity in rural areas? Specifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available\nfootprint today for fixed wireless, and would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today, except for copper infrastructure, so\nkind of the true rural areas?\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nSo on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that we continue going. That has not changed. When it comes to this\nlead-sheathed cables discussion, as said, I mean, we're going to go through this scientific, we're going to do test. We're going to do it fact-based\nand then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to\nkeep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline, so he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time.\nOn the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we -- the first 70, i would say ish, I would say is C-band mark PEAs that is\ncalled, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. In the next step, it's going to be\nmuch more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunity because usually, they are even less different options for customers in those\nareas.\nSo of course, that's going to create opportunities for us. That doesn't mean that we are changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million\nby 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I am driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that\nwe are a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So definitely, we see opportunities coming with the next tranche of C-band.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nThanks, Bryan.

Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst\nOn the wholesale -- on the cable side, maybe just discuss the wholesale wireless ARPUs broadly speaking. Do you think you can grow wholesale\nwireless ARPUs. And then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly, obviously good\nstrength there? And then lastly, on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk how often are your workers exposed to lead? I'm sure you have to\nlog that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers? And have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nThere were many questions in all there. So let me start by the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access again, we have a premium\nproduct. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose with the best areas or what the best service is. So\nwe think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access.\nAnd I think you just think about when we started with unlimited, you start with one plan and then you start to work with different segmentation\nbecause ultimately, we are in a very, very big consumer business, where so many differentiated customers that needs different type of services. So\njust think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question.\nAnthony Skiadas  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nYes. On the cable partnership, I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship,\nand we're very satisfied with the relationship and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier.\nTimothy Horan  - Oppenheimer & Co.

On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much. And\nwhether it's sustainable what the risks are to a recent trend and on FWA. I just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned\nabout this week.\nHans Vestberg  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO\nOn the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon has been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with\nthe right price at the right time. So definitely that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades, that has not hampered our\nway of growing our business or taking customers, and we will continue to work with that.\nThen, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect there's going to be a product coming out in the second half.\nWe're excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos, of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially\ndisciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic. And when store traffic comes we are really good and\nhaving a good conversion rate, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important.\nAnd then second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless customer. There\nare so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So of course, having different tiers and pricing becomes very normal in order to\nmeet customer demands. So it's just how we do, and that will continue to do and see how the market is developing.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nBrad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator\nThe final question for today will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk  - LightShed Partners, LLC - Partner & TMT Analyst\nI just want to actually do a follow-up to that upgrade question. The last 2 years, Hans, the upgrade rate has actually declined in the third quarter.\nSo I just want to kind of piece meal together, like you said you're not going to do handset promotions earlier in the call.\nObviously, everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but in the last answer, it sounded like you thought people would upgrade more,\nbut what, what seasonal trends should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially because\nit's been typically down sequentially in the third quarter for the last 2 quarters, maybe COVID had some impact on that, I don't know.\nAnd then my second question on CapEx. There's some debate, I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of\nlike, oh, your C-band is going to get deployed, but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things, you're going to have to come back and do\ndensification very quickly.\nSo any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean, obviously, we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter.

Thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot -- I don't know anything about any launch of the product, how exciting it's going to be. But ultimately,\nthat usually drives more upgrades. So let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple\ncoming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they are coming in this half. I cannot reveal what they are doing. But clearly, we're excited for that.\nOn the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good, sustainable level of\nthis densification, it's part of our strategy already. So -- and many of the things that we're already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for\nthe full spectrum already from the beginning, then we turn on when we get those tranches.\nSo there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible on CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort\nof BAU around $17 billion to $17.5 billion. I feel really good about that because we go through this extremely detailed. So we feel confident.\nBrady Connor  - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR\nYes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, that was all the time we had for today.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.
